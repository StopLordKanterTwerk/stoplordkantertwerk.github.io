                <h2>Who is LordKanter</h2>
                <p>Known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNwjNe8taYP0F3V7R7z5M6g" target="_blank">LordKanter</a>, Matt is an American Youtuber who creates content off the game called Minecraft. 
                LordKanter has recently grown in popularity through his series Recreating DreamSMP. Not too long ago Kanter hit 30,000 subscribers and I think is legit dying for YouTube rank on a 
                Minecraft Server called "<a href="https://hypixel.net/" target="_blank">Hypixel</a>." Although he did not start out this way. LordKanter Joined YouTube on July 20, 2020 and made his first video titled, 
                "Salty Springs From Fortnite In Minecraft!!!" He eventually went on to build other places from that dead game like Pleasant Park, Risky Reels and Craggy Cliffs. Kanter then made a 3 video series 
                called "All Tommyinnit Music From Streams and Videos." These videos were a huge success. One of them has gained over half a million views. As of now, LordKanter is still working on his dreamSMP 
                series also coming as a huge success for him.

                <h2>What <em>is</em> LordKanter Twerk</h2>
                <p>LordKanter first twerked when we was going to stream with his friends. It was a normal day; nothing unusual. However that one simple mistake changed the course of humanity forever. As LordKanter 
                    was playing <a href="https://client.badlion.net/" target="_blank">Badlion Client</a>, he made the mistake that caused the world to go into a depression. At 6:29pm CDT, LordKanter 
                    purchased the twerk emote. Not thinking anything of it, he found it funny. <em>Although not so funny now is it Buster! </em>but thats not all, Being said this was all recorded and shared on every 
                    social media platform. But there is hope. Finally one man had enough. He was sick and tired of all this and had to put it to a stop. He made a video titled "Stop LordKanter Twerking."

                <h2>How Lordkanter Twerk is Affecting Society</h2>
                <p>As the Previous video said, LordKanter is twerking on trees, he is twerking on rocks, hes twerking on your mother and he is twerking on your cat. Who knows what else hes twerked on.
                This simple yet outrageous act has caused a lot of controversy and made millions upset as to weather this content is acceptable or not. It has spread all over twitter, YouTube, TikTok and even 
                National News Networks. Joebama, President of the United States has even come as far as declaring a State of Emergency saying, "C'mon man!" he has also stated that the entire economy has crashed 
                saying that Americas broke.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> img1. Economy predictions described here by the U.S. Department of the Treasury<br />img 2. supporters vs. non-supporters of Lordkanter Twerk</p>
